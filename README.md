# tasker
Write down tasks, set their priorities and assumed completion time, and sort them.

Right now the application is sorting with weights as follows: 1 hour is equal to 0.5 priority, or: 1 level of priority is 2 hours of work time.

# Required packages
All you need is Newtonsoft's Json package and you're ready to go.
